# Fun with Matrix Exponentiation
This repository contains the code for my post ["Fun with Matrix Exponentiation"](https://andersource.dev/2019/08/25/fun-with-matrix-exponentiation.html).
* _unit-conversion_: Example of unit conversion.
* _hierarchy-aggregations_: Example of aggregating accross two hierarchies using a recipe dataset from Kaggle.
* _txt2svg_ is a utility I used to convert simple text descriptions of graphs to svg figures of those graphs.
